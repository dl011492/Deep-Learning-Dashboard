I keep the best model results in this folder. 

For MNIST is the CNN Small.
For Fashion MNIST is also is the CNN Small.
For Kaggle is VGG16-DA.
For Oxford-IIIT is Segmentation (the only one implemented).
For imdb MLP sent. analyis (the only one implemented).

I usually rename these files so that I know how I made them.
One can use these files to make model predictions (with sample visualizations) ans measure the
test accuracy of the model without having to train the model again.
